        <p>First Day Hikes 2024: Where to Hike on New Year's Day in All 50 States
         From candlelit nighttime walks in the snow to epic treks on the Appalachian Trail, this is how hikers and parks in every state are ringing in the new year. Pick one and start 2024 off in style.</p>
        <p>This iconic coastal trail on Vancouver Island's west coast offers stunning ocean views and rugged, challenging terrain. Backpacking this beauty over multiple days is a good plan, and you can ponder its history as you go â€” it was initially established as a life-saving path in 1907, to aid in the rescue of survivors shipwrecked along the island's treacherous coast.</p>

        <h2>Highlight of the week: John and Kelsey Experience</h2>
    
        <p> John and I made a completely spontaneous decision to head off for a week of hiking on Mallorca after a death in the family and no break from work for month. He and I were ready for a major change of scenery - and a week filled with exercise and good food.
            Of course we could have gone to the Rockies for some spring skiing but quite frankly by the end of March, I am over winter. Another year we had done a fabulous week long hiking holiday on the Lycian Way in Turkey with On Foot Holidays. I checked to see what they offered in March and hiking on Mallorca was one of the options.</p>
